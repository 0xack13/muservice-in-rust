# Building a microservice in rust

This project is a companion to my talk at ConFoo about building a rust project.

The actual code is in different branches.

Run `git checkout step-01` to get to the next step.

* [x] Bootstrap Rust project
* [ ] Add tokio and anyhow and run as an async binary
* [ ] Library and binary structure and setup tracing
* [ ] Add axum and setup a hello world endpoint
* [ ] Explore different extractors for Path, Body and Query Params
